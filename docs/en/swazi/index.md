# Moving Forward: SwaziLang Advanced Topics

Congratulations!  
You’ve completed the foundational chapters of SwaziLang. By now, you’ve learned:

- What SwaziLang data types are, how to declare variables, how to operate on these variables and data types
- How to write functions(`kazi`/`tabia`) and control flow (`kama/vinginevyo`, loops)
- How to use lambdas, ternary expressions, and template literals
- The basics of Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance)
- How to use switch statements and organize complex logic

---

## What You Can Do So Far

With these tools, you can:

- Build interactive programs that make decisions and repeat tasks
- Organize your code using functions, classes, and objects
- Handle user input, process data, and output formatted results
- Write clean, maintainable, and reusable code

You’re ready to tackle real-world problems and start building your own projects!

## What’s Next? The Advanced Level

Now, you’ll explore more powerful SwaziLang features, including:

- **Modules**: Organize, structure, and share your code across files and projects.
- **Built-in Modules**: Use SwaziLang’s standard library for essential tasks (math, file operations, dates, etc).
- **Built-in Functions & Objects**: Leverage ready-made global utilities for string, array, and object handling.

### Why Learn These?

- **Scalability:** Advanced features let you build bigger, more reliable programs.
- **Reusability:** Modules help you split code into manageable, reusable pieces.
- **Power:** Built-ins save you time—no need to reinvent the wheel.

## How to Make the Most of Advanced SwaziLang

- Experiment with modular programming: Start splitting code into separate files/modules.
- Explore the standard library: Check out built-in modules for common tasks.
- Use global objects and functions to simplify your logic.
- Combine everything you’ve learned—control flow, OOP, and modules—for real applications!
