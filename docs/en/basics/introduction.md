# What is SwaziLang?

As already said, SwaziLang is just a programming langauage.
You write code just like you would in any langauages, ie. python or javascript but the keywords most of them are swahili inspired keywords.

# Who created SwaziLang and why?
SwaziLang was first created by a bunch of losers, who thought they could make a programming langauage that can be used mostly by swahili speakers (The East African Community) to write softwares and mainly for easy learning of programming among this Community.
- It was first made in around 2016 - 2020 (a bunch of losers tried to develop it but didn't make it out), and later in 2023 was made a interpreter software written in c++ called `swazi` that powered it and gave it more purpose.
- The software was written by `Azin David` and `Godie Joseph` in about a year and dropped it and later in 2025 it was retrieved and rebuild again to serve modern programming

# What can it be used for?
1) Learn programming
2) Web development
3) Matchine Learning (because it feels like python)
4) Data science
5) Scripting and Automation
6) Game development
7) And many more as it grows.

# What is the latest Version of SwaziLang?
The latest stable Version of SwaziLang is Version 1.11.0

# Where can you code SwaziLang?
You can write and code SwaziLang through the SwaziPen browser-based IDE that is best suited for learning.
