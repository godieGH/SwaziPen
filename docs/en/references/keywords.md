# SwaziLang Reference: Keywords

SwaziLang uses a set of reserved **keywords** for its syntax, control flow, modules, classes, and more.  
These keywords have special meaning—you cannot use them as variable or function names!

## Notes

- Always use keywords as intended—they cannot be redefined or used as variable/function names.
- Some keywords have alternate meanings depending on context (e.g. `kama` in control flow, `kama` in module import).
- For full details and usage, see the specific documentation sections.
